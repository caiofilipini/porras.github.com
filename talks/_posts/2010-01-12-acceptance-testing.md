# Acceptance Testing with RSpec, Capybara & friends
## [madrid-rb](https://madridrb.jottit.com/) February 2010

I gave this talk (in Spanish) in the [Madrid Ruby User Group](https://madridrb.jottit.com/) monthly meeting. It was a comprehensive description of my favorite Ruby testing stack at the time (it remains my favorite with very little change). Specifically, it contained a discussion about Cucumber and why I didn't like it for most projects.

These were the slides I used:
