# The Total IDE
## [RejectConf](https://rejectconf.jottit.com/) Conferencia Rails 2010

This was a short talk about UNIX being the ultimate IDE.

The tone of the event (in the night, informal, and mainly beer driven) fitted very well with the slides being in <span style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"'>Comic Sans</span>, specially after a friend betted I wouldn't dare to do it ;)
